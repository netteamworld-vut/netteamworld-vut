👋 Hi, I'm @netteamworld-vut
👀 I'm interested in full-stack development with .NET and JavaScript ecosystems, microservices architecture, cloud-native applications, and real-time communication systems
🌱 I'm currently learning .NET 9, Docker containerization with Kubernetes orchestration, .NET Aspire, and advanced Angular/React patterns
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open source .NET libraries, microservices frameworks, and cross-platform application development
📫 How to reach me: Through GitHub issues or pull requests on my repositories
😄 Pronouns: He / him
⚡ Fun fact: I maintain a tech stack that spans 3+ frontend frameworks (Angular, React, Blazor) and multiple database engines (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) all connected through a unified architecture!
